This often times involves government subsidies, high tariff barriers and/or artificially maintained domestic currencies to protect local industries. Import substitution is also a policy strategy, e.g. as an attempt to utilize underused capacities, reduce regional unemployment or protect infant industries. This form of economic protectionism has helped some countries industrialize in the past, (such as South Korea and Taiwan) but these steps can be fraught with economic risks, most notably potential economic inefficiencies, uneconomical use of available resources, and ultimately leading to higher prices.During 60’s and 70’s import substitution strategy became popular in developing countries like such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Some nations still use it today. It extensively uses trade barriers to protect domestic industries from import competition and can lead to complete self sufficiency. For e.g. if fertilizer imports occur import substitution may call for establishment of a domestic fertilizer industry to produce replacement of fertilizer imports.Advantages: Risks of establishing home industry to replace imports are low, easier to protect domestic manufactures against foreign competitions; it provides jobs and reduces import expenditures.Disadvantages: Import substitution breeds corruption as the economy is more protected and within, for small nations, for indigenous development cost becomes very high of setting up own units, due to trade restrictions there are no incentives to increase efficiency as they are away from competition."

general science physics mcqs,The pulling sensation when we stand near a running train can be explained on the basis of ___:,"[""Archimedes Principle"",""Bernoulli’s law"",""Avogadro’s Hypothesis"",""Newton’s Third Law of motion""]",multiple choice,Bernoulli’s law,,https://www.gktoday.in/quizbase/general-science-physics-mcqs,"Notes:It is just a feeling, we are actually being pushed towards the moving train by the atmosphere surrounding us. The reason can be explained with the help of “Bernoulli’s law”. When a train is stationary, the pressure at points in surrounding area would be uniform and at atmospheric pressure. As the train starts and gains momentum, the increasing velocity of the train depletes the pressure at the points in the area at close proximity to the train. Now the pressure at these points is less than atmospheric pressure. The points at an area farther away from the train are at same atmospheric pressure as before. It has to be noted that, the velocity of the train affects pressure of the areas closer to the train and not of those a little far away. Naturally, air from the points at atmospheric pressure (relatively high) would rush towards the low pressure area (the area immediately surrounding the train) or towards the train. Thus a person standing near a moving train will actually be pushed towards the train by the gush of wind destined to the low pressure area."

The All-India Congress Committee proclaimed a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called “an orderly British withdrawal” from India. The call for determined, but passive resistance appears in his call to Do or Die, issued on 8 August at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay.Almost the entire Indian National Congress leadership, and not just at the national level, was imprisoned without trial within hours after Gandhi’s speech; most spent the rest of the war in prison. It was a leaderless movement, with the reigns of the movement in the hands of the masses. The British refused to grant immediate independence, saying it could happen only after the war ended. Sporadic small-scale violence took place around the country but the British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945, and suppressed civil rights, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. (Hence Statement 1. and 2. are correct)In terms of immediate objectives Quit India failed because of heavy-handed suppression, weak coordination and the lack of a clear-cut programme of action. However, the British government realized that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for postwar became how to exit gracefully while protecting Britain’s allies, the Muslims and the princes.(Hence Statement 3. is also correct)"

Beautiful rainbows, which sometimes arch across the sky during rain showers, do not appear during snow showers. This is because a snowflake has a different shape than a raindrop. When raindrops fall from the sky, they are round like tiny balls. To form a rainbow, the sun must shine on the raindrops. When a ray of sunlight reaches a raindrop, some of the light enters the drop and refracts. This means that the ray bends at the surface of the drop and changes its direction. Different colors of light refract in slightly different directions. This is how the white sunlight, which is really a combination of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet light, gets separated into different colors. Then each colored ray of light takes its own path inside the raindrop and exits in a different direction. Therefore, when you look up at the rain in the sky, each color of light comes at you from a different direction, and you see a rainbow. In contrast to the simple round shape of raindrops, snowflakes are six-sided and flat. When sunlight shines on snowflakes tumbling and falling through the air, the many different surfaces of the snowflakes cause the light to be refracted and reflected in many different directions, and the light is too scattered to form a rainbow. However, in special situations snowflakes can create interesting and beautiful displays with sunlight. Parahelia, sometimes called “mock suns” or “sun dogs,” are bright spots that appear to the left and right of the sun. They form when rays of sunlight refract through thin plate-like snowflakes that are falling flat through calm air. Often each bright spot has a reddish side and a bluish side. The rainbow is not located at a specific distance, but comes from any water droplets viewed from a certain angle relative to the Sun’s rays. Thus, a rainbow is not a physical object, and cannot be physically approached. Indeed, it is impossible for an observer to manoeuvre to see any rainbow from water droplets at any angle other than the customary one of 42 degrees from the direction opposite the Sun. Even if an observer sees another observer who seems “under” or “at the end” of a rainbow, the second observer will see a different rainbow further off-yet, at the same angle as seen by the first observer."
